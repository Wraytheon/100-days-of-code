![logo](logo.png)

## About
Hello World,<br>

This repository serves as my journal, tracker, and accountability tool as I complete the #100DaysOfCode challenge. As I journey through this challenge I will find triumph, failure, pain and glory and I invite you to join me on this quest. Here goes nothing/everything:
> #100DaysOfCode with Chloe Wray

<br>


## Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

<br> 

## Rules

* Code a minimum of one hour each day for the next 100 days.
* 

<br>

## Additional/Semi-optional Rules

* I will tweet about my progress every day using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag
* I will push code to github every day so that anyone can see my progress.
* I will update the [Log](round-One/README.md)
* I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
* Each day, I will reach out to at least two people on Twitter who are also doing the challenge.
