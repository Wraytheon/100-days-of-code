- **100Devs Class 23 JS Api For Beginners stream + notes** 
-  6:35-2-15am
<br>
    - **What I learned:** 
<br>
        - APIs connect two applications so they can exchange data
        - A URL is a type of API - a web API
        - How APIs work
          1.  You make a request to the server using a URL
          2. The server hears the request, compiles the requested data and sends a response as a JSON (JS Object Notation) - basically an object thats coming back from the server
          3.  We can now use that object(JSON) to get the data out
        - We use the fetch() method to send the URL interface request to the server that holds it
