- CodeWars: 8Kyu Find The Smallest Integer In The Array & 7Kyu Get The Middle Character 
    - **Time Spent**: 1hr15min
    - **What I learned:** <br>
Spread operator can be used to expand arrays/iterables into individual elements and are very helpful when using Math.min/max with an array without having to extract each array item. <br>
You can use .substring in place of charAt in some circumstances. The substring method allows you to extract part of a string and return it.
    - **Challenges:** <br>
I had to look up examples for both of these kata. One of them contained a js class which is something I haven't learned yet and I wasn;t sure how to go about extracting the correct letters for the string in the 7Kyu kata.
