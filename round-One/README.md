- [x] 2+ codewars

<br>

### **Today I ..**

<hr>

- FrontendMentor FAQ Accordion Card
    - **Time Spent**: 3hr45min
    - **What I learned:** <br>
Making an accordion with html, css, and js
<br>

    - **Challenges:** <br>
Trying to understand the javascript I used from the internet in order to tweak it for my project. Can't get site to open with accordion closed.
<br>

<br>

- CodeWars: 8Kyu Find The Smallest Integer In The Array & 7Kyu Get The Middle Character 
    - **Time Spent**: 1hr15min
    - **What I learned:** <br>
Spread operator can be used to expand arrays/iterables into individual elements and are very helpful when using Math.min/max with an array without having to extract each array item. <br>
You can use .substring in place of charAt in some circumstances. The substring method allows you to extract part of a string and return it.
    - **Challenges:** <br>
I had to look up examples for both of these kata. One of them contained a js class which is something I haven't learned yet and I wasn;t sure how to go about extracting the correct letters for the string in the 7Kyu kata.
<br>
<br>

### **Notes, Challenges, & Thoughts**

- **FAQ Accordion card** -- 9:15pm-10:25pm
  - **What I learned** <br>
    - Learned a bit more about positioning with relative and absolute values, your parent element should be set as relative with child as absolute in many cases. <br>
    - Used the *filter* property to darken an SVG until I can figure out why its not rendering as dark as it should.
  - **Challenges:** <br>
    - Having a hard time dealing with the SVG images. This one is being used as a shadow under another image but the SVG shows up very faintly and i'm not sure how to fix it. 
    - Still can't figure out how to get accordion to load as closed.

- **js.info Array Methods "Filter Range"** -- 10:37-10:45pm
  - **What I learned:** <br>
Was struggling with how to use the filter method when I first tried this a month ago but I was able to navigate the syntax this time. **[Link to work](https://codepen.io/wraytheon_/pen/mdpNxBZ)**

<br>


### **Notes, Challenges, & Thoughts**

<hr>

- Feeling proud that I can see the progress i'm making by solving problems that I wouldn't have been able to a month ago. Sometimes I wonder if things would be easier if I didn't have this neurodivergence and chronic illness weighing me down but it doesn't matter. This is what I've got and I am determined to make the most of it .. no matter how exhausted or hopeless it feels at times.

<br>

### **Today I ..**

<hr>

- **js.info Array Method "Filter in Place"** -- 6:39pm-7:14pm
    - **What I learned:** <br>
        - To filter something "in-place" means you are modifiying that object in its original place in memory using no extra arrays, objects, pointers or memory. Essentially, you are writing expressions that will alter the original array without any helper methods that create copies of the array. How I understood it as a metaphor: Instead of making a copy of a piece of art, altering it and then pasting over the original, you are directly painting on the original.
          - [Source](https://damely-tineo.medium.com/in-place-operations-javascript-array-edition-c0ae40d9ad81) , [Source 2](https://dev.to/seanwelshbrown/in-place-algorithms-what-are-they-and-why-use-them-e5p)
<br><br>
    - **Challenges:** <br>
        - I still wasn't able to solve this problem. I wasn't entirely sure what it means to filter something "in place". 
        - Still having trouble with arrow functions and .forEach syntax.
<br><br>

- **CodeWars #30 "Reversed Sequence" kata** -- 7:24pm-8:07pm
  - **Challenges:** <br>
    - Couldn't complete this kata.
    - Didn't know how to how add elements to an empty array. Tried using .forEach and it didn't work.
    - Couldn't decide on how to iterate over empty array, adding elements that result from an artihmetic expression. 

<br><br>

### **Notes, Challenges, & Thoughts**

<hr>

- Feeling pretty bummed at the lack of productivity and the fact that I wasn't able to finish either of the problems I worked on. Eventually got so tired and brainfoggy that I decided to get off and get some sleep. Tomorrows a new day.

- [ ] CodeWars "Reverse Sequence" kata
- [ ] js.info "Filter Range In Place"


### **Today I ..**

<hr>

- **FCC JS Algs - Basic JS Section** 
-  3:17pm - 3:40pm, 6:53pm-12:00am
<br><br>
    - **Challenges:** 
<br>
        - Ran into issues severral times while doing the Record Collection project. Wasn't sure how to access property keys and values separately and used *==* comparisons where *===* was needed. 
        - The Nesting For Loops project proved to be very difficult. I couldn't figure out how to return the result of the arrays AND the subarrays together. 
<br><br>
    - **What I learned:** 
<br>
        - If you have multiple inputs with the same output you can represent them in switch statements with multiple *case* statements in a row. <br>
          - [Example](https://www.codegrepper.com/codeimages/javascript-switch-case-multiple-lines.png)
        - For functions that only require a return of *true* or *false* use a boolean return statement rather than an if/else statement.
        - To create an object property that is an array simply use basic property syntax + basic array syntax :
          - `const exampleBoject = {
exampleArray: ["arrayItem", "arrayItem2"]`
        - To access the value of a property that is stored as a variable use the following syntax:
          - `const propertyAsVar = "propertyValue"` <br>
            `const accessProperty = objName[propertyAsVar]`
          - [Example](https://codepen.io/wraytheon_/pen/JjvjYYY)
        - You can create an object to lookup values rather using *switch* or *if/else* statements (most useful when your input data is limited to a certain range).
          - [Example](https://codepen.io/wraytheon_/pen/NWMWGRB)
        - How to iterate over an array placing values with a while loop. [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-while-loops)
        - How to iterate over an array placing odd values with a for loop [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-odd-numbers-with-a-for-loop)
        - For loops don't have iterate one at a time. You can change the iteration/increment expression so that the function increments by a number other than 1 (like it does with i++ and i--)
          - `for (let i = 1; i <= 9; i += 2) {` <br>
`  // your code here`<br>
`}`
        - Read a little about recursion. Still not fully understanding.

<br>


### **Notes, Challenges, & Thoughts**

### **Today I ..**

<hr>

- **FreeCodeCamp JS Algorithms & Data Structures - JS Basics** 
-  8:33 - 10:49pm
<br><br>
    - **Challenges:** 
<br>
      - I seem to find myself struggling often with using parameters correctly. With Objects I find difficulty in correctly selecting the right property/value/nested object. For the Profile Lookup project I had to look up the answer. I wasn't far off but i'll be redoing this soon to see if I can figure it out on my own next time.
<br><br>
    - **What I learned:** 
<br>
      - To get a whole number from Math.random combine it with Math.floor.
      - To get a (fairly) random whole number between two numbers use this setup:
        - `function randomRange(myMin, myMax) {` <br>
 `return Math.floor(Math.random() * (myMax - myMin + 1) + myMin);` <br>
`}`<br>
`console.log(randomRange(2, 20)) //returns random numbers between 2 and 20 (including 20)`
      - parseInt returns an integer from strings, an can optionally take a second paramter representing the radix (base) of the desired integer. Ex: `parseInt(str, 2)` will convert strings to binary equivelents because binary is a base 2 system.
      - Practiced with the conditional ternary operator: `a === b ? "Equal" : "Not Equal"`
      - Learned about using multiple ternary conditionals at a time and the importance of proper indentation for readability:
        - `function checkSign(num) {`<br>
`return (num === 0) ? "zero"`<br>
  `: (num > 0) ? "positive"`<br>
  `: "negative"`<br>
`}`
      - Used recursion to take in two parameters representing the range for the desired array and return an array of the numbers in the range without using any loop syntax.
        ```
        function rangeOfNumbers(startNum, endNum) {
          let arr = [];
          if (endNum - startNum === 0) {
            let equalNum = arr.push(endNum)
            return arr;
          } else {
            const counter = rangeOfNumbers(startNum, endNum - 1);
            counter.push(endNum);
            return counter;
          }
            return [];
        }
          console.log(rangeOfNumbers(1,4))
        ```
        <br>
      - Used recursion, if statement and unshift to create a function that recursively returns an array of numbers in descending order:

        ```
        function countdown(n){
          let arr = [];
          if (n < 1) {
            return arr;
          } else {
            const counter = countdown(n - 1);
            counter.unshift(n);
            return counter;
          }
        }
        console.log(countdown(10))[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        ```
