    - **Challenges:** 
<br>
        - Ran into issues severral times while doing the Record Collection project. Wasn't sure how to access property keys and values separately and used *==* comparisons where *===* was needed. 
        - The Nesting For Loops project proved to be very difficult. I couldn't figure out how to return the result of the arrays AND the subarrays together. 
<br><br>
    - **What I learned:** 
<br>
        - If you have multiple inputs with the same output you can represent them in switch statements with multiple *case* statements in a row. <br>
          - [Example](https://www.codegrepper.com/codeimages/javascript-switch-case-multiple-lines.png)
        - For functions that only require a return of *true* or *false* use a boolean return statement rather than an if/else statement.
        - To create an object property that is an array simply use basic property syntax + basic array syntax :
          - `const exampleBoject = {
exampleArray: ["arrayItem", "arrayItem2"]`
        - To access the value of a property that is stored as a variable use the following syntax:
          - `const propertyAsVar = "propertyValue"` <br>
            `const accessProperty = objName[propertyAsVar]`
          - [Example](https://codepen.io/wraytheon_/pen/JjvjYYY)
        - You can create an object to lookup values rather using *switch* or *if/else* statements (most useful when your input data is limited to a certain range).
          - [Example](https://codepen.io/wraytheon_/pen/NWMWGRB)
        - How to iterate over an array placing values with a while loop. [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-while-loops)
        - How to iterate over an array placing odd values with a for loop [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-odd-numbers-with-a-for-loop)
        - For loops don't have iterate one at a time. You can change the iteration/increment expression so that the function increments by a number other than 1 (like it does with i++ and i--)
          - `for (let i = 1; i <= 9; i += 2) {` <br>
`  // your code here`<br>
`}`
        - Read a little about recursion. Still not fully understanding.

### **Notes, Challenges, & Thoughts**

<hr>

- Definitley overbooked myself today. Thought i'd easily be able to finish the JS Basics. I swear it feels like time passes at 3x speed in my brain. Learned alot though.

<br>

### **Tasks for Tomorrow**

<hr>

-  Redo Record Collection project : [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/record-collection)
- Redo Nesting For Loops: [Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/nesting-for-loops) 
- Finish JS Basics
- Complete Reversed Sequence kata
- Add new concepts to Anki
